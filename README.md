# Final Project

## Install Instructions

On vagrant vm (don't run `vagrant up` as admin/root):
- Clone the project
- npm install
- testrpc
- truffle migrate --reset
- npm run dev

Project should be running on http://localhost:8080


## Limitations of the project :
The project is working with testrpc and also with geth (But I didn't had enough time to put any progress bar or something indicating that the transaction was waiting to be processed). Mist is not compatible with the site.
<br/>Also It's currently only possible to create one TollBoothOperator (And as asked the first TollBoothOperator is created during the deployment). I didn't want to spend too much time on the GUI and focus more on the smart contract and on finishing the project first, as it took me a lot more time than I expected.

Don't hesitate to reach me on slack or at louis.lonjon@gmail.com, if you encounter any issues.
